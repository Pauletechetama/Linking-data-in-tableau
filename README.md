# Linking-data-in-tableau
This repository shows how I made and visualized JOINS in Tableau

# About the project 
In this project i reviewed a scenerio, linking different data sources in Tableau, created visualizations using multiple datasets, visualized comparisons and combined data. I created a visualization that shows the co2 emisssion per capita for each country from 2000-2011. I provided a visual presentation that not only allows someone to visually compare co2 emission but also provides information about each country's population, Gdp and energy use.

# Dataset
The project contains Co2 dataset with 8 fields that includes co2 data cleaned, co2(kt)pivoted, co2(kt)raw data and others, Energy dataset of 3 fields that includes country, year and energy use, A total population dataset of 3 fields that includes country, year and total popolation, lastly, Gdp total dataset of 3 fields that includes country, year and current gdp. The datasets includes emission for each country between the years 1960-2011. The links to the datasets are below. When you open the dataset below, you will immediately see the About page load with a single URL code at the top,please navigate to the bottom of the document and you can access all the raw and cleaned co2 data by clicking on different sheets
